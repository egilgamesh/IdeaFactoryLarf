# Ideas Factory App

Idea Factory App is web based application built based on ASP.Net MVC and using vue is javascript framework for fly render card u,
Vue used since it is light is library and this will tune App performance, 


We used mixen between web api CRUD for control all idea card ui, and use ASP.net mvc based on entity framework for login page
 
Note#1: I separate the project for two parts of you wish to download it faster, or you can use the main folder which contain complete project

Note#2: I rebuild the whole project by trying as much I can to use can libraries and using vue.js to decrease project size to upload it easily since I face internet issue
