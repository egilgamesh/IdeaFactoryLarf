# Ideas Factory App

Idea Factory App is web based application built based on ASP.Net MVC and using vue is javascript framework for fly render card ui,
Vue used since it is light is library and this will tune App performance, 


We used mixen between web api CRUD for control all idea card ui, and use ASP.net mvc based on entity framework for login page
 
Note#1: I separate the project for two parts if you wish to download it faster, or you can use the main folder which contains the complete project.

Note#2: I rebuilt the whole project by trying as much I can to use libraries, vue.js has been used to decrease project size
